Agentic Finance Studio 🚀

Institutional Sentiment → Actionable Crypto Signals

Agentic Finance Studio is an AI-powered Telegram bot that helps traders turn market sentiment into clear, actionable insights.

Instead of reacting to noise, the bot delivers structured intelligence for assets like BTC and XRP, combining sentiment data, price tracking, and smart alerts.

🎯 Project Vision

Retail traders often struggle with:

- Information overload
- Late entries
- Lack of clear signals

Agentic Finance Studio solves this by combining:

1. Institutional Sentiment
   Data from SoSoValue (when available)

2. Market Data Intelligence
   Multi-source pricing (SoSoValue → CoinGecko → Binance)

3. Actionable Alerts
   Simple insights delivered via Telegram in real-time
   
🏗️ Modular Architecture (The Stack)

To ensure high availability and professional-grade performance, the studio is built on a decoupled, three-tier stack:
 1. Intelligence Layer: Utilizes the SoSoValue API for real-time institutional sentiment indices and news filtering.
 2. Signal Engine: Powered by Asynchronous Python for non-blocking technical analysis (Quant TA) and institutional Whale Alert monitoring.
 3. Execution Layer: Integrated
